<h1>Getting Educated</h1>
<div class="text">
  <p>If you're interested in sports med, you can try to volunteer at your school and taking classes on it. Some schools may let you work during school sporting events so that you can get a general idea of the sports medical field. In order for someone to become a sports med physician, you need to have a Masters Degree and a Doctors of Medicine Degree during their undergraduate years. To become a sports med physician, you must complete medical school, earn a license, complete a residency and fellowship, and earn board certification in sports medicine. Medical school is a 4 year program and the last two years of that would be clinical rotations. </p>
  <p>Residency programs cover in depth specialty training. During this time period, you can begin to focus on surgical and nonsurgical areas. Once done with the residency program, you can apply for a sports medicine fellowship program which is usually about one year long. </p>
  <p>Primary care sports medicie fellowships are open to people who have completed residencies in most kinds of medicine. Primary care sports medicine fellows typically work with multiple levels of team sports and practice what they would have to be doing while attending a sports game. </p>
